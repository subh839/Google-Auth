This project contains unit tests for a Blazor-based application. The tests focus on validating the behavior of the `LoginModel` class, which handles user authentication.

## Project Details

- **Language**: C# 12.0
- **Testing Framework**: xUnit
- **Mocking Library**: Moq

## Key Features

- **Unit Tests**:
  - `OnPostAsync_InvalidCredentials_ReturnsPageWithError`: Verifies that invalid login credentials return a page with an error.
  - `OnGet_NoExternalLogins_ReturnsEmptyList`: Ensures that when no external logins are configured, the `ExternalLogins` property is null.

## How to Run Tests

2. Build the solution to restore dependencies.
3. Open the **Test Explorer** in Visual Studio.
4. Run all tests or specific tests as needed.

## Dependencies

- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity**: For user authentication and identity management.
- **Moq**: For mocking dependencies in unit tests.
